# Placeholder for demo.gif

This file should be replaced with an actual 6-10 second animated GIF demonstrating the MCP Revit Bridge workflow.

## Recommended Demo Flow

1. Terminal showing mock mode startup: `python -m revit_mcp_server`
2. Demo client sending tool requests
3. Output showing:
   - Health check response
   - Document opened
   - Export quantities generated (CSV file)
4. File explorer showing generated artifacts in workspace
5. Audit log file showing request tracking

## Creating the Demo GIF

Use tools like:
- **ScreenToGif** (Windows): https://www.screentogif.com/
- **LICEcap** (Cross-platform): https://www.cockos.com/licecap/
- **Peek** (Linux): https://github.com/phw/peek

Keep file size under 2MB by:
- Recording at 10 FPS
- Using 640x400 resolution
- Limiting to 8-10 seconds
- Optimizing with tools like gifsicle

Replace this placeholder file with the actual GIF before release.
