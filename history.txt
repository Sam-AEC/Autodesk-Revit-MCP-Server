2026-01-06 Revit MCP Reconstruction Log

This history is reconstructed from the conversation stored in "New Text Document.txt". Prior git history has been intentionally removed at the user's request so we can start over cleanly.

Key decisions for this rebuild:
- Build an MCP server (Python + stdio) with 25 Revit-focused tools, JSON schema validation, audit logging, and a mock mode for CI.
- Pair it with a Revit bridge add-in (.NET 4.8) that exposes those tools through local HTTP, using ExternalEvent execution and real Revit API logic where possible.
- Provide thorough documentation (README, docs/, examples/, scripts/) describing the workflow, configuration, tools, and operation.
- Keep the workspace sandboxed (WORKSPACE_DIR), enforce audit records, and log every tool call with deterministic outputs.
- Commit consistently after each substantive change so the new history reflects our rebuilt milestones.

Next steps: recreate the scaffold (packages/, docs/, scripts/, examples/, bridge add-in), implement the MCP tools and bridge commands, and document everything per the plan.
